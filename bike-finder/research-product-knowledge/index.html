    <h1>Researching Bikes</h1>

    <h3>Sources</h3>
    <p>I began by reading a few articles on buying a bike. The most informative articles were from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-hybrid-commuter-bike/">The Wirecutter</a> 
        and <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/bicycle.html">REI</a>; both gave great information on the factors that go into a bike purchase, and some of the more reputable brands. I also looked at various 
        bike manufacturers such as Priority Bikes, Jamis, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/32327/153518/4/132491?merchant=Marin%20Bikes">Marin Bikes</a> to learn about their products, features, and marketing.

    <h3>Buyers' Considerations</h3>
    <p>
        The first and most important factor when buying a bike is the type of bike to purchase. This depends on where the bike will be used
        and what the bike will be used for. This is mostly dependent on the riding surfaces: paved roads and paths, natural surfaces, 
        all-terrian, and dirt roads and trails. Once a buyer has determined their primary riding surface, the next step is to consider cost.
    </p>

    <h3>Cost and Performance</h3>
    <p>
        While the first priority of most buyers is to purchase a bike depending on their riding surface, also important is the cost of the bike. Certain
        customers who are more experienced with bikes might be more willing to pay a premium for better components. Lots of variables like the material of the frame,
        suspension, gears, and etc. are all important factors towards one's biking experience and its cost.
    </p>

    <h3>The Purchase</h3>
    <p>
        When making the actual purchase, there are a variety of stores that sell bikes, including local stores that have the advantage of allowing consumers to
        test their bikes in person. When purchasing online, most of the bike manufacturer's websites where they list their bikes do not actually allow you to
        purchase the bike. They instead provide stocklists or stores across the United States that sell their bikes. Occasionally, bike manufacturers like Priority Bicycles
        have their own shipping. There was interesting copy on a few of the merchants' websites that discussed more cosmetic benefits of their bikes, such as preventing
        one's pants from becoming stained. The copy and details listed on the different websites sometimes changes based on their perceived consumer base.
