    <h1>Wireframe Testing</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Test 1 with Christine</h3>
        <p>
            Since my wireframe was drawn and there is not a lot of placeholder text related to actual bikes,
            Christine used some of the annotations I had provided. All of the movement through the flow seemed
            straightforward. The individual bike page was clear enough that Christine could infer what the 
            text scribbles would be without having any real text.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Test 2 with Kathleen</h3>
        <p>
           Kathleen had similar comments as Christine. I think the lack of placeholder text may be hurting the
           effectiveness of some of the walkthroughs. Aside from that, the flows and screens are clear enough to
           understand for specific personas.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Test 3 with Christina</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to the first test, we were able to parse through the flows pretty quickly. When analyzing my wireframes
            for a user looking for a safe study bike, she determined that, if comprehensive enough, the quiz would likely
            lead her to the proper bikes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>General Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        After wireframe testing, it seems like a lot of the functionality that completes the user stories is rooted in the
        quiz being successful. Because the quiz is the crux of the site, it will be important to add more wireframes detailing the
        quiz. Additionally, it may be helpful to do some research on effective content/copy for the CTAs, as they'll be important
        in addressing key user flows. 
        <br>
        In summary, it will be important to add a little more detail in the copy for the mid-fidelity wireframes so that the quiz and
        landing page can more clearly address the user flows.
