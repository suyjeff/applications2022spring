    <h1>Researching UI Conventions</h1>
    
    <div class="store-details">
        <h3>Walmart</h3>
        <p>While finding the item, Walmart's navigation bar has dropdown menus that
            allow users to search for items by department, and also a search bar. The
            items are tiled across the page in a grid. Common layout to provide large image of the produce in the middle of the page. Another common 
            element is the right pane that has all the information about reviews, size, and color options that the user can choose. The layout is 
            fairly standard when it comes to components – pretty similar to other shopping websites. 
            Because most of the elements follow the standardized design it’s easy to understand what the elements of the websites are 
            going to perform. Option selector shows preview of other options. This options to be able to select certain options 
            of the same product and view them at the same tab makes it very convenient for the user to compare and contrast.
            Walmart’s “add to cart” button morphs into another button that allows the user to change the 
            quantity of the item that the user selects. It’s not expected but a useful 
            combination of the “buy” function and “quantity” function.
            The bolded lines that is used to highlight selected options of the product is a 
            good indicator user of what version of the product they have chosen
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="store-details">
        <h3>Target</h3>
        <p>
            Target offers various filters and categorization so that users can find the specific item that they want easily
            UI elements are similar to walmart
            Target offers a left side plane that user can use to filter out various items. 
            It’s more prominent in it’s space and user can spot it pretty clearly
            With electronics, since there’s many products with similar specs, Target focuses on being able to 
            filter results to narrow down options for the user
            When clicking on a certain item, the page leads to detailed page of the product
            Target makes clear indication of information hierarchy by placing certain text and buttons on the very top space of the webpage. The website provides description but it’s placed at a lower space of the website and the text is smaller, which is a purposeful design to convince user to buy products.
            Once you click “buy” button, there’s a pop up page with two buttons. The most prominent button highlighted with red background is “continue shopping”. The other button is “add to cart”. The “add to cart” button is the one that the user actually clicks to add the item to the cart.
        </p>

        <h3>Etsy Lip Gloss</h3>
        <p>
            The user can see tons of categories immediately, without having to enter a dropdown like in Walmart or Target. Despite the items being
            from smaller creators, they are still laid out in a grid in a similar fashion to most stores. Etsy's specific listings
            are more focused on images and have a gallery with more clear arrows. The most prominent information abotu the item is the name, but Etsy
            also features the amount of sales of an item. This is likely because Etsy caters to individual sellers rather than a large
            warehouse. Etsy does not have image previews for many options, rather, they have a dropdown list. This pushes the user
            to have to "trust" the seller if they want to purchase a style that is not pictured. Immediately below the gallery are reviews
            which is different than larger sellers. These reviews are categorized between the item and the seller, possibly to gain
            greater trust with the consumer (as they might be wary of purchasing from a smaller store). They also have great copy that
            pushes the user to trust the seller, which plays into the many UI elements that are all built upon trust.
        </p>

        <h3>St. Louis Bar and Grill</h3>
        <p>
            The first thing that appears on this food website is a location pop-up. There are large images of the different
            food items and deals. Similar to other wbesites, they have categories that show different items on their 
            menu within a dropdown menu. This allows users to browse immediately without having to delve deeper or download
            some menu. Once you click into a menu item, the items are laid out in tiles but there is a large description of
            the item within the tile, rather than on the subsequent page. When you click to "order" a food item, the many different
            locations across the country are listed, along with a map of the country. The important CTAs are all colored in a bright
            orange/red to encourage users to click. The rest of the flow is very similar to most food delivery websites. If you choose
            to buy from a specific restaurant, StL Grill gives you the menu of the entire restaurant as to restart the ordering process. If
            you click to order an item, it is not added to your cart which is inconvenient for the user, but likely increases
            sales for the restaurant. Additionally, it is important to notice that the price of the item is not listed until you reach a much later stage.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h3>What elements or patterns seem universal?</h3>
        <p>Across all websites, items are laid out in a very similar grid that makes images of the items prominent, along with several CTAs in each 
            grid item. Additionally, all of the shopping experiences had very clear navigation bars that featured categories/departments as the first/second
            item in the navigation bar. The navigation bar also had a search bar that allowed users to search for items by name. The individual item pages all featured
            large gallery views for the item along with a right column with information about the item. All of them made details like price, size, reviews, and etc. fairly
            prominent; however, the "Add to cart" CTA was always the largest and contrasted the most with the rest of the page.
        </p>

        <h3>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</h3>
        <p>When we looked at Etsy's shopping flow, it was pretty clear that Etsy was trying to accomplish some different goals than the larger stores. Because
            Etsy mainly features products from smaller businesses and indivuduals, it's important for them to establish some sort of trust with the user. Users
            are likely less confident in the product quality from a random seller than they might be with a more reputable brand. Because of this, Etsy features
            reviews for each item and reviews for the seller more prominently on their product pages. They even go as far as to push the reviews for each item above
            the common section that lists other similar items. This pursuit of trust was very different in Etsy's approach.
        </p>

        <h3>Any stand out patterns? Could any other stores have applied that technique?</h3>
        <p>Walmart's "Add to Cart" button transforms into a +/- button that changes quantity after its active state. This is a really interesting sales
            tactic that encourages users to buy MORE (when they might not have been in that mindset beforehand). The delightful animation also makes the interaction
            much more appealing and would likely cause more conversions.
        </p>

        <h3>How did you feel when interacting with these sites?</h3>
        <p>When analyzing these shopping flows from a designer's perspective, it is much easier to recognize the different dark patterns that companies use
            to "trick" users into more purchases. Often, it is clear that companies are attempting to either guilt users into making a purchase, or are deliberately using
            the placement of components to make specific information more difficult to access or scan. The best sites are those that offer useful information to the user such as
            reviews and product information. Mini interactions that make the shopping experience more delightful are nice, but secondary to the main goal of the user
            making an informed and financially sound (or not) decision.
